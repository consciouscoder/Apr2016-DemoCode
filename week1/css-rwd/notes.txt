Responsive Web Design

Mobile First Development
    Designing a site for mobile FIRST
        - Not worrying about the desktop initially
        - Often a simpler design
    
    As our screen sizes get larger we can add more UI
        components / features and change the layout
        - Progressive enhancement
            Avoid a watered-down mobile experience
            
        - vs. Graceful Degradation (desktop first)
            As screen gets smaller - start ripping
                things out of the site
                
CSS
    Units
        px       - least flexible
        vw / vh  - view width / view height
        em / rem - refer to the width of the 'm' character
                    - ems look to the parent container and 
                        apply a coefficient to the size
                    - rems look to the font-size on the html tag
                        (default font size)
        %        - refer to parent container OR body
    
    Media Queries
        - Applying different styles based on screen size
        - selectors and rulesets


    Specificity
        How important a style is and whether or not it should
            override / be overridden by other styles
        The more specific a selector is, the harder it is
            to override (cannot override an inline style)
            
        File order matters!  If 2 selectors carry the same
            specificity, the one LOWER in the file will
            take precedence
            
        Determined by the selector
                    ID       Classes       Tags
#myDiv              1          0            0    => 1 0 0
span.header-text    0          1            1    => 0 1 1
div span.myText     0          1            2    => 0 1 2
div span h1 marquee 0          0            4    => 0 0 4
