box-sizing
    - Has to do with the box model in CSS
    - Changes what parts of the box model are included
       in the dimensions

display
    - ALL elements are either BLOCK or INLINE
        - Block : Takes up full width, line break before and after
        - Inline : Wraps content, no true dimensions
        - Inline-block : best of both worlds, has dimensions but will also share line space
    - Used to CHANGE the display type of the elements
    - Allows us to set a display type of INLINE-BLOCK
    
position
    - 4 types of positioning
    - often used with coordinate CSS properties
    1. Static - what all elements have by default 
        (elements are NOT positioned)
    2. Relative - Doesn't change where the element takes
        up space, only where it is rendered
    3. Fixed - Positioned with respect to the WINDOW
        stays with the user as they scroll
    4. Absolute - Positioned with respect to their
        closest positioned ancestor (or the body).
        Absolutely positioned items are removed from
        the document flow

float
    - is used to wrap content from other 
        elements around themselves
    - can float an element LEFT or RIGHT (NONE)
    
    - clear / overflow
        -CLEAR 
            : designed to prevent an element from sharing
            space with a floated element
            : LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH
        -OVERFLOW
            : typically used to control overflowing content
            : Also used to change float interactions
