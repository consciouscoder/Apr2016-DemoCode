Node JS

What?
    Is a javascript runtime environment
    Uses the v8 engine, just transplanted into a commandline application

Differences vs browser
    - no window object / global namespace
    - no document object
    - console.logs GO TO THE TERMINAL, NOT THE BROWSER

    - Based off of a MODULE system since there is no global namespace

<script src="angular.js">
<script src="angular-route.js">
angular.module('')
    .controller('')
    
Node - REPL
    Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
    
Modules - How can we access them?
    3 Ways
        1. Including core modules (fs)
        


We can specify arguments to our node files
    we gain access to them in an array at 
    process.argv
    arguments vector (argv)
    
NPM
    Service to manage and download node modules
    NPM is not a Package Manager
    Where you pick the modules you want your own application to use
    
    npm is used to install modules and keep them up to date (or out of date if you so choose)
