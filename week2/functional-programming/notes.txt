Functional programming
    - focusing on more algebraeic concerns and structures
    - Never CHANGING data, only creating NEW data
    
    
    2 Big Focuses
        1. Immutability
            - Don't change your data
            - Removing STATE from our data
            - Create NEW data
            
            Pure Functions
                - Focus on Input/Output
                - Data goes in, NEW data comes out
                    - Use it(store in a variable) / throw it out
                - No SIDE EFFECTS
        
        2. Composability
            - Way we structure all the little pieces
            - Abstracting functionality into smaller legos
            - Fitting those legos together for more functionality
